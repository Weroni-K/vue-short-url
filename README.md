# URL Shortening Page Project ðŸ”—

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This is a URL Shortening API landing page built with Vue.js, leveraging the Clean URI API to create shortened links. This project is based on a Frontend Mentor challenge.

## Project Overview ðŸ“œ

This project features a single-page website that provides a URL shortening service. The goal was to recreate the provided design layout and ensure it is responsive and accessible across different devices. I deployed and host the project on Netlify to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors that occur with GitHub Pages.

## Key Features ðŸ”‘

1. URL Shortening: Integrates the Clean URI API to shorten URLs.
2. Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts.
3. Challenge-Driven: Based on designs and content provided by Frontend Mentor, adhering closely to the challengeâ€™s specifications.
4. Axios for API Requests: Utilizes Axios to handle HTTP requests to the Clean URI API, ensuring smooth URL shortening functionality.
5. Netlify Functions (Proxy): Uses Netlify serverless functions to act as a proxy, addressing CORS issues and ensuring seamless communication with the Clean URI API.
